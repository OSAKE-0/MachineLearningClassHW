# MachineLearning Assignments
  Practial practices carried out in machine learning course

#### Lab 1 
Music Genre
- According to the tempo,chroma_stft and spectral_centroid to classify music genre using Perceptron
- Using logistic regression to predict the labels

Boston House Price Predict
- Process data: Split data into train / test sets using a ratio of 70%/30%, and normalize data to make mean equals to zero and standard deviation equal to 1 .
- Predict price by using LinearRegression.


#### Lab2
Kuzushiji Classification with Support Vector Machines
- Implement SVM with different kernals : Linear kernal / Polynomial kernel with degree= 2 / polynomial kernel with degree = 3 / RBF kernel 
- Compare different kernals by training and test error and report the best parameters.
- Apply regularization method on the LogisticRegression model using different C (regularization strength)
- Plot the confusion matrix for the SVM classifier and for logistic regression, measure the accuracy on each single class.


#### Lab3
Characters Classification with Neural Networks

- Implement a feed-forward Neural Network for prediction and try to optimize by pruning parameters
